### Recommended Simulation Updates:

**Current Code (from engineSim.ts):**
```typescript
tireDiameterIn: 23.5 // Should update based on actual tire selection
tireWidthMm: 185    // OEM is 195mm
wheelbaseM: 2.620   // ✓ Correct
cgHeightM: 0.48     // ✓ Correct
frontWeightBias: 0.61 // ✓ Correct
```

**Suggested Additions:**
